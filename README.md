For the 1st question, please find the export API collection for POSTMAN in WeCheer.postman_collection.json file. For API automation project I prefer POSTMAN also.

For the 2nd question, I wrote a simple scenario using cypress to verify the number of bottles from the UI compare with API.

For the 3rd question, to test the mobile version we can use Appium to automation the UI part and use Restassured if we need to integrate with some API testing.
